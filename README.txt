Project Idea-

1. Reel n Roll is an online movie ticket booking website that lets users browse currently showing and upcoming movies, view show timings, and choose their preferred cinema.
2. Users can select seats through an interactive seating layout and complete bookings digitally.
3. The platform brings movie details, schedules, and seat availability into one simple, user-friendly experience.
